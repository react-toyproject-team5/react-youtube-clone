Get Surfshark VPN at https://surfshark.deals/undecided - Enter promo code UNDECIDED for 83% off and 3 extra months for FREE!  Permanent magnets are a critical resource for renewables, because the generators in some wind turbines and motors in electric vehicles rely on them to run. A Floridian high school student has just shown us how to make a better electric motor without rare earth magnets. Another company is using cloud computing to try to improve electric motor performance — also without rare earths. There’s some exciting advances being made when it comes to electric motors, but how much of a difference can they make?\n\nCORRECTIONS: I've trimmed a couple of short sections from the video that were creating confusion.  I didn't mean to imply that AC motors use magnets, but the wording during some moments made it sound like I was.

There’s some exciting advances being made when it comes to electric motors, but how much of a difference can they make?\n\nCORRECTIONS: I've trimmed a couple of short sections from the video that were creating confusion.  I didn't mean to imply that AC motors use magnets, but the wording during some moments made it sound like I was.  Magnetless motors are not a new thing, but optimizing their design for high efficiency, high torque, without rare earths opens the door for more use cases.\n\nWatch How Can A Wind Turbine Be Motionless? https://youtu.be/OkRqVBpO2BQ?list=PLnTSM-ORSgi7UWp64ZlOKUPNXePMTdU4d\n\nVideo script and citations:\nhttps://undecidedmf.com/why-this-17-year-olds-electric-motor-is-important/\n\nFollow-up podcast:\nVideo version - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4-aWB84Bupf5hxGqrwYqLA\nAudio version - http://bit.ly/stilltbdfm\n\nJoin the Undecided Discord server:\nhttps://geni.us/undecided-discord\n\n👋 Support Undecided on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/mattferrell\n\n\n⚙️ Gear & Products I Like\nTesla and smart home gear:\nhttps://kit.co/undecidedmf\n\nGreat sustainable products for your home:\nhttps://geni.us/buildwithrise\n\nUndecided Amazon store front:\nhttps://geni.us/undecidedAmazon\n\nFun, nerdy t-shirts:\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedShirts\n\nAbstract Ocean Tesla Accessories:\n15% Discount - Code: \"Undecided\"\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedAO\n\nJeda Tesla Wireless Charger/USB Hub:\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedJeda\n\nTesla Referral Code:\nGet 1,000 free supercharging miles \nor a discount on Tesla Solar & Powerwalls\nhttps://ts.la/matthew84515\n\nVisit my Energysage Portal:\nResearch solar panels and get quotes for free!\nhttp://www.energysage.com/p/undecided/\n\nOr find community solar near you:\nhttps://communitysolar.energysage.com/?rc=p-undecided\n\n\n👉 Follow Me\nTwitter \nhttps://twitter.com/mattferrell\nhttps://twitter.com/undecidedMF\n\nInstagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mattferrell\nhttps://www.instagram.com/undecidedmf\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/undecidedMF/\n\nWebsite\nhttps://undecidedmf.com\n\n\n📺 YouTube Tools I Recommend\nAudio file(s) provided by Epidemic Sound\nhttp://bit.ly/UndecidedEpidemic\n\nTubeBuddy\nhttps://www.tubebuddy.com/undecided\n\nVidIQ\nhttps://vidiq.com/undecided\n\n\nI may earn a small commission for my endorsement or recommendation to products or services linked above, but I wouldn't put them here if I didn't like them.

        "description": "Check out part 1 here! https://youtu.be/0e8woEkKmG8\n\nHELLO FRIENDS!! In this installment, we continue our exploration of every hotel on the Vegas strip, taking on the 14 hotels on the East side of the Strip. Still big fans, and still providing our thoughts on the room, vibes, and activities at each hotel - again, just in case you need it. We took on everything the strip had to throw at us - heat, celebrity restaurant pasta dishes, serenading gondoliers - until we finally made it to the end. We came, we saw, we stayed - here are the final 14! What do you guys think?
